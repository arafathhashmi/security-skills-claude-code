# scan_repo.sh — deterministic evidence collection for a production-readiness review.
#
# Purpose: replace "the model eyeballed the repo" with reproducible, quotable output.
# Every finding is printed as path:line so the audit can cite it and a second run
# can be diffed against the first.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scan_repo.sh <repo-path> [--base <git-ref>] [--exclude <regex>]
#
#   --base    compare against this ref to scope the change surface (default: origin/main
#             if it exists, else main, else master, else skip diff sections)
#   --exclude extra path regex to ignore on top of the vendor defaults
#
# Exit codes: 0 = scan completed (findings are NOT failures), 1 = bad usage/path,
#             2 = the scan did NOT complete — a search engine refused a pattern, or no
#                 search engine was found at all. A section that could not run prints
#                 SEARCH FAILED and must never be read as "clean".

# One look-ahead took the whole section down for as long as it was here. This

# is the one CI takes. The portable choice is to use no look-around at all: match
# plainly, then drop the lines we did not want. What that costs is that rejection is
