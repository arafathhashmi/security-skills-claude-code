# extension: glibc implements it, BSD and macOS libc do not, and bash's =~ uses the
# system regex library. Every pattern here used \b, so on macOS none of them matched
# and this guard allowed every install without a word of warning. The class permits
# / and . before the command name so a path invocation (/usr/local/bin/npm install)
# still matches, while mynpm install does not.
